## History & Contributors

The BookSwap project began at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu), and it is was it is today thanks to the hard work of many dedicated students and alumni over the years.

BookSwap is the brainchild of **David Caratelli** and **Stephen Suellentrop**, who came up with the idea for a campus-centric online textbook marketplace while they were students at NU. Together, they built the original BookSwap website, which launched at Northwestern in Fall 2010.

The original site owed much of its early success to **Kate McGarrahan**, who led graphic design and marketing.

In Winter 2011, mockups for a redesigned BookSwap were developed as part of a class project by a team of Northwestern computer-science students: **Ethan Romba**, **Leif Foged**, **Steven Howard**, and **Eric Castillo**.

Around the same time, Stephen, David, and Kate had begun working on a separate redesign effort with the help of several members from Northwestern's founding chapter of [Design for America](http://designforamerica.com/): **Hannah Chung**, **Hansol Bang**, **Vincent FitzPatrick**, **Ruby Munjal**, **Michael Narea**,  **Maxime Ollivier**, and **Uzair Qarni**.

Ethan brought his team's insights to this larger redesign effort, and together they iterated on the new design throughout the spring based on feedback from several user testing sessions and focus groups.

Development of the new site finally began in Summer 2012 when Northwestern student **Srinivas Balusu** fleshed out a functional prototype under Ethan's guidance. **David Harris**, **KC Chilamkurti**, and **Krish Suresh** provided additional ideas and design feedback during this time. Ethan went on to build the final version of the site throughout the following winter (featuring a color scheme designed by **Anthony del Gigante**), and BookSwap "2.0" launched in March 2013.

Ethan open-sourced the code for the new BookSwap website in November 2013 so that college students everywhere can benefit from this incredible team effort and continue to build on their work for years to come.
